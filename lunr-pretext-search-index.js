  "body": " Nick's Section: Limits of Trigonometric and Exponential Functions  Continuity of Trigonometric and Exponential Functions  It can be shown that the trigonometric and exponential functions such as , , , , etc. are continuous at every input value where they are defined. As a consequence of this, many limits of this sort may be evalauted by simply plugging in the limiting value.     The Squeeze Theorem  The more difficult question is how to evaluate limits of these sorts of functions which are in the indeterminate form . One valuable tool to help with limits of these sorts is the Squeeze Theorem.  The Squeeze Theorem   Let be an open interval containing the number . If , , and are function such that for all values of in the interval (except possibly for ) and then as well.     Suppose that is a function such that for all . Since , we may conclude that by virtue of the Squeeze Theorem.     Suppose that is a function such that for all . Can the Squeeze Theorem be used to find the value of ?    Yes, .  Yes, .  No, it is not possible to determine the value of .   We cannot use the Squeeze Theroem to determine the value of since .      Two Important Limits  It can be shown by a variety of arguments that for values of near . Once this is established, the Squeeze Theorem then permits the following conclusions         Once we know these two trigonometric limits, we can use them along with limit properties in a variety of ways illustrated in the following examples.   Evaluate .  By factoring out the constant ,    Evaluate .  By factoring out the constant ,    Evaluate .  Multiplying by the number will not change the value of the limit. Here, we choose the form .
